\section{Measurements}
Figure~\ref{fig:fixedWindow} shows the performance of a protocol with a fixed window size. 
The best score we were able to achieve was -4.5 log(Throughput/Delay) with a window 
size of 15. However, the measurements were not very stable and varied by as much 
as 0.1 between different runs with the same window size.

Our first try to implement an AIMD scheme did not produce very good results; we got
-5.84 log(Throughput/Delay) when adding $ 1/w $ to the window size on
every ACK and dividing by 2 on every timeout (timeout set to 1000 ms). A slower 
increase of $ 1/w^2 $ improved the score to -4.72. Another approach we tried was to
change the timeout, where we found out that decreasing the timeout to 100 ms improves
the score to -5.28 (while maintaining the standard AIMD). By combining both approaches
we managed to improve the score up to -4.12, by using a timeout of 100 ms, an additive 
increase of $ 1/w^2 $ on every ACK, and a harsher decrease of $ w \leftarrow \sqrt w $ 
on every timeout.

The delay-triggered scheme proved to be competitive with AIMD. We experimented with 
changing the window size based on when the RTT crosses a given threshold. 
Table~\ref{tab:delayTriggered} summarizes the results. The best score of -4.16 was achieved with a threshold 
of 100 ms, an increase of 0.1,\footnote{A non-integer increase effectively means 
that the window size changes only when it reaches the following integer} and a 
decrease of 1.
